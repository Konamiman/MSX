## Konamiman's MSX software repository

This is a compilation of all the MSX software that I have been developing since the mid-90s and have survived the successive diskette-to-ZIP disk-to-hard disk-to-CF card-to-SD card migrations. It contains the sources for all the software available at [my MSX page](http://www.konamiman.com), plus some previously unpublished sources (such as the ones for NestorBASIC).

While the newest sources have the code comments and identifiers in English, the oldest ones have them in Spanish. I'm sorry but I don't have the time to start translating it all, any contribution in this regard will be welcome.

Most of the source code in this repository is in Z80 assembler. These files are intended to be assembled with Compass, other assemblers will probably not understand the macro syntax. To compile these from a modern machine you can use [Sjasm 0.39h](https://github.com/Konamiman/Sjasm/releases/tag/v0.39h).

Some of my MSX projects have their own repository and are therefore not included in this one:

* [Nextor](https://github.com/Konamiman/Nextor)
* [MSX2 Technical Handbook](https://github.com/Konamiman/MSX2-Technical-Handbook)
* [MSX UNAPI Specification](https://github.com/Konamiman/MSX-UNAPI-specification)
* [Obsolete Procedure Call](https://github.com/Konamiman/OPC)
* [Rookie Drive FDD ROM](https://github.com/Konamiman/RookieDrive-FDD-ROM)

Oh, and last but not least: if you like these rusty pieces of code **[please consider donating!](http://www.konamiman.com/msx/msx-e.html#donate)** My kids need moar shoes!

Enjoy!
