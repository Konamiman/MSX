1.  Introduction

   MSX-UNAPI is a standard procedure for defining, discovering and using
   new APIs (Application Program Interfaces) for MSX computers.  The
   MSX-UNAPI specification is described in a separate document.

   This document describes an UNAPI compliant API intended for hardware
   that implements Ethernet networking capabilities.  The functionality
   provided by this API covers the link layer of a network
   communications stack; as such, it mainly provides routines to send
   and receiving raw Ethernet frames to and from an Ethernet network.
   There are also auxiliary routines to check for network availability,
   to obtain the local Ethernet address, or to configure reception
   filters.

   The intended client software applications for this API are
   implementations of the higher level layers of the communications
   stack, typically, TCP/IP stacks.  Anyway it can be useful for other
   types of software as well, for example network traffic monitors.

   Note that it is not mandatory to have actual underlying Ethernet
   hardware in order to implement this API.  As long as the routine
   signatures and behaviors are preserved, the implementation will ve
   valid, even if it acts on a completely different type of hardware, or
   on no harwdare at all (for example, an Ethernet emulation API over a
   serial or JoyNet cable could be developed).


2.  API identifier and version

   The API identifier for the specification described in this document
   is: "ETHERNET" (without the quotes).  Remember that per the UNAPI
   specification, API identifiers are case-insensitive.

   The Ethernet API version described in this document is 1.1.  This is
   the API specification version that the mandatory implementation
   information routine must return in DE (se Section 3.1).


3.  API routines

   This version of the Ethernet API consists of 11 mandatory routines,
   which are described below.  API implementations may define their own
   additional implementation-specific routines, as described in the MSX-
   UNAPI specification.

                             Ethernet UNAPI                February 2010


3.1.  ETH_GETINFO: Obtain the implementation name and version

Input:  A  = 0
Output: HL = Address of the implementation name string
        DE = API specification version supported. D=primary, E=secondary.
        BC = API implementation version. B=primary, C=secondary.

   This routine is mandatory for all implementations of all UNAPI
   compliant APIs.  It returns basic information about the
   implementation itself: the implementation version, the supported API
   version, and a pointer to the implementation description string.

   The implementation name string must be placed in the same slot or
   segment of the implementation code (or in page 3), must be zero
   terminated, must consist of printable characters, and must be at most
   63 characters long (not including the terminating zero).  Refer to
   the MSX-UNAPI specification for more details.

3.2.  ETH_RESET: Reset hardware

   Input:  A  = 1
   Output: -

   This routine resets the underlying hardware and/or the API
   implementation state variables to its initial state.  After executing
   this routine, the hardware (if present) and the implementation must
   remain in the same state as after a computer reset or after the
   implementation is installed (whatever applies).  More precisely, the
   state after the reset must be as follows:

   o  The Ethernet address is appropriately set to its default value (it
      is optional to allow changing this address, see Section 3.3).
   o  Networking is enabled.  (See Section 3.5).
   o  Received frames, if any, are discarded.  Any frame transmission in
      process when the routine was called is aborted.
   o  Duplex mode is set to half-duplex, when it is possible (see
      Section 3.6).
   o  Reception filters are set to accept broadcast and small frames.
      Promiscuous mode is disabled.  (See Section 3.7).

3.3.  ETH_GET_HWADD: Obtain the Ethernet address

   Input:  A  = 2
   Output: L-H-E-D-C-B = Current Ethernet address

   This routine obtains the current Ethernet address of the
   implementation.  The address is mapped to registers HL, DE and BC in
   a way that makes it easy to store and retrieve it for Z80, which



Soriano                                                         [Page 3]

                             Ethernet UNAPI                February 2010


   stores 16 bit values int little-endian format.  For example, the
   address returned by this routine can be stored at address X with
   these instructions: LD (X),HL - LD (X+2),DE - LD (X+4),BC.

   Ethernet addresses (also called MAC addresses) are unique for each
   physical card and are intended to never be changed after the card is
   manufactured.  See Appendix A.

   If the implementation supports it, the hardware address can be
   changed by using the ETH_SET_HWADD routine (see Section 3.12).

3.4.  ETH_GET_NETSTAT: Obtain network connection status

   Input:  A  = 3
   Output: A  = 0 if NOT connected to an active network
                1 if connected to an active network

   This routine checks whether the underlying hardware is connected to
   an active network or not (in other words, if the Ethernet cable is
   appropriately plugged and there is carrier).

   It is allowed to use loopback methods (that is, to send a frame and
   check if it is received back) to check the network connection status.
   Therefore, it may take a while to execute, so it is not advisable to
   invoke it too often.

3.5.  ETH_NET_ONOFF: Enable or disable networking

   Input:  A = 4
           B = 0: Obtain current state only
               1: Enable networking
               2: Disable networking
   Output: A = State after routine execution:
               1: Networking is enabled
               2: Networking is disabled

   This routine logically enables or disables networking activity.  When
   disabled, no frames will be recevied (or received frames will be
   automatically discarded); the behavior when trying to send a frame
   with networking disabled is undefined.

   When the underlying hardware offers ways to phisically disable
   networking (such as entering in low power mode or similar), these
   must be used.  Otherwise, disabling must be done by software.

                             Ethernet UNAPI                February 2010


3.6.  ETH_DUPLEX: Configure duplex mode

   Input:  A = 5
           B = 0: Obtain current mode only
               1: Set half-duplex mode
               2: Set full-duplex mode
   Output: A = Mode after routine execution:
               1: Currently half-duplex mode set
               2: Currently full-duplex mode set
               3: Current mode unknown or duplex mode does not apply

   Offering the ability to change the duplex mode is optional.  When not
   possible (because only one mode is supported, or because it is not
   possible to change the current mode by software), the routine must
   simply return the current mode, as if it were called with B=0.

   When it is possible to change the duplex mode by software, the
   default mode (after a reset, see Section 3.2) should be the half-
   duplex mode.

   The "Unknown or does not apply" mode is primarily intended for
   implementations that do not act on real Ethernet hardware.  For these
   implementations, the concept of "duplex mode" may not make sense.

3.7.  ETH_FILTERS: Configure frame reception filters

 Input:   A = 6
          B = Filter bitmask:
              Bit 7: Set to return current configuration only
              Bit 6: Reserved
              Bit 5: Reserved
              Bit 4: Set to enable promiscuous mode, reset do disable it
              Bit 3: Reserved
              Bit 2: Set to accept broadcast frames,
                     reset to reject them
              Bit 1: Set to accept small frames (smaller than 64 bytes),
                     reset to reject them
              Bit 0: Reserved
 Output: A = Filter configuration after execution
             (bitmask with same format as B at input)

   This routine allows to set or to check the current frame reception
   filters.  Frames whose destination Ethernet address matches the
   current address of the underlying hardware must always be accepted;
   these filters decide what to do with special frames.

   When bit 7 of B is set, all other bits will be ignored, and the
   routine will simply return a bitmask with the current configuration,



Soriano                                                         [Page 5]

   without modifying anything.

   When bit 4 is set, promiscuous mode is enabled.  In this mode, all
   received frames are enabled, regardless of their destination address.
   This mode is usually never enabled, except for special purposes such
   as network analysis.

   When bit 2 is set, broadcast frames are accepted.  These frames have
   a destination address of FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF, and are intended to be
   received by all hosts in the network.  Broadcats frames are usually
   always accepted.

   When bit 1 is set, small frames (frames smaller than 64 bytes) are
   accepted.  These frames violate the Ethernet specification but may
   anyway contain useful information.

   Reserved bits must be set to zero at input, and are always returned
   as zero at output.  These bits may be used in future versions of the
   Ethernet API specification.

3.8.  ETH_IN_STATUS: Check for received frames availability

   Input:  A = 7
   Output: A = 0: No received frames available
               1: At least one received frame is available
           When A=1:
               BC = Size of the oldest available frame
               HL = Bytes 12 and 13 of the oldest available frame

   This routine checks whether there are received frames available to be
   retrieved or not.  When A=1 is returned, it means that there is at
   least one received frame available to be retrieved; there is no way
   to know how many frames are available.

   When at least one frame is available, BC returns the total size of
   the oldest frame.  This size includes the Ethernet header and data;
   it corresponds to the frame format outlined in Appendix A, which does
   not include the frame preamble nor the checksum.

   When at least one frame is available, BC returns bytes 12 and 13 of
   the oldest frame.  These bytes contain ether the frame size or the
   ether-type, depending of the frame type (Ethernet II or IEEE802.3).
   Since the frame data starts at a different boundary on each frame
   type, client software may use this information to decide where to
   retrieve the frame, so that the data boundary is always at the same
   memory address.  This may ease frame data manipulation.

   The oldest received frame can be retrieved using routine 8, see



Soriano                                                         [Page 6]

   Section 3.9.

3.9.  ETH_GET_FRAME: Retrieve the oldest received frame

   Input:  A  = 8
           HL = Destination address for the frame, or
                0 to discard the frame
   Output: A  = 0 if frame has been retrieved or discarded
                1 if no received frames are available
           BC = Size of the retrieved frame

   This routine retrieves the oldest received frame (copies it to the
   specified memory address), and removes it from the implementation
   internal buffer (usually belonging to the underlying harwdare), so
   that when the routine is called again, the next received frame is
   obtained.  Successive calls to this routine must return the received
   frames in the same order as they are received from the network.

   The received frame will include the Ethernet header and data, it will
   not include the frame preamble nor checksum.  The frame format will
   be one of the two formats outlined in Appendix A.

   Implementations may not allow the destination address to be a page 1
   address (in the range #4000-#7FFF).  Client software should not use
   this range as destination address when invoking this routine, in
   order to correctly interoperate with such implementations.

   When the specified destination address is zero, the frame is not
   retrieved but just discarded.  That is, it is removed from the
   implementation internal buffer but not copied to memory.

   This specification does not impose a minimum size for the internal
   reception buffer, other than being big enough to hold one complete
   frame.  But of course, the bigger the better, so that it can hold
   enough frames, thus minimizing the probability of losing frames.
   When this buffer is full, new frames must be discarded so that the
   oldest ones are preserved.

3.10.  ETH_SEND_FRAME: Send a frame

   Input:  A  = 9
           HL = Frame address in memory
           BC = Frame length
           D  = Routine execution mode:
                0: Synchronous
                1: Asynchronous
   Output: A  = 0: Frame sent, or transmission started
                1: Invalid frame length
                3: Carrier lost
                4: Excessive collisions
                5: Asyncrhonous mode not supported

   This routine sends to the network the frame that the client software
   has composed in memory, at the address specified in HL.  The frame
   format must be one of the two outlined in Appendix A; that is, the
   frame must be composed of Ethernet header (including the local
   Ethernet address, see Section 3.3) and data only, with no preamble
   nor checksum.  (When there is real underlying Ethernet hardware, it
   is expected that the hardware itself will generate the checksum;
   otherwise, the implementation must generate it prior to sending the
   frame.)

   Implementations may not allow the frame source address to be a page 1
   address (in the range #4000-#7FFF).  Client software should not use
   this range as source address when invoking this routine, in order to
   correctly interoperate with such implementations.

   Allowed frame lengths are 16 to 1514.  If the frame is smaller than
   64 bytes, the implementation must pad it with zeros up to 64 bytes
   (usually the underlying hardware will do it automatically).

   All implementations must support the syncrhonous execution mode.  In
   this mode, the routine will start the frame transmission; then will
   wait until transmission has finished (successfully or not) and will
   return the appropriate success or error code (in this mode, error
   code zero means "frame successfully sent").

   Implementations may optionally support the asyncrhonous execution
   mode, and should indeed support it when there is real Ethernet
   hardware that handles the transmission independently of the Z80 code
   execution.  In this mode, the routine initiates the transmission
   (unless frame length is invalid, in which case A=1 must be returned)
   and returns immediately with A=0 (meaning "frame transmission
   started").  Frame transmission status can then be ckeched by using
   routine 10 (see Section 3.11).




Soriano                                                         [Page 8]

                             Ethernet UNAPI                February 2010


   To check whether asynchronous mode is supported or not, try to send a
   dummy 16 byte frame (12 zero bytes for source and detination address
   and then #FFFF for the ether-type) in asyncrhonous mode, and check
   the return code: it will be 0 if asyncrhonous execution is supported,
   5 otherwise.

3.11.  ETH_OUT_STATUS: Check frame transmission status

   Input:  A = 10
   Output: A = 0: No frames were sent since last reset
               1: Now transmitting
               2: Transmission finished successfully
               3: Carrier lost
               4: Excessive collisions

   This routine returns the state of the last frame send operation
   initiated by routine 9 (see Section 3.10).  It is intended for being
   used after an asyncronous execution of that routine, but will return
   valid information for syncrhonous executions as well.

   In case of syncrhonous execution, this routine will return the same
   error code that routine 9 returned, except that code 0 is converted
   to 2, and code 1 (invalid length) is not considered a failed
   transmission (since the routine returns without attempting the
   transmission).

   The obtained information is persistent: successive executions of this
   routine will always return the same value until another frame is sent
   (or attempted to be sent) or the reset routine (see Section 3.2) is
   invoked.

3.12.  ETH_SET_HWADD: Set the Ethernet address

   Input:  A  = 11
           L-H-E-D-C-B = Ethernet address to set
   Output: L-H-E-D-C-B = Ethernet address after the routine execution

   This routine sets the hardware address if the implementation supports
   it.  When changing the address is not supported, the routine must do
   nothing and return the current address as if the ETH_GET_ADDRESS
   routine were called (see Section 3.3).  Setting the address should
   not be allowed unless there is a good reason for it (for example,
   when it is not possible to store the address in non-volatile memory).

   Ethernet addresses (also called MAC addresses) are unique for each
   physical card and are intended to never be changed after the card is
   manufactured.  See Appendix A.

Appendix A.  Ethernet frame formats

   In this appendix the Ethernet frame formats are described.  This
   information is provided for reference only, and it is not exhaustive.
   More detailed information can be found on Internet.

   There are two types of Ethernet frame: Ethernet II, and IEEE802.3
   with SNAP extension (IEEE in short).

   The Ethernet II frame format is as follows (one line is 32 bits):

        0                   1                   2                   3
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The IEEE frame format is as follows:

   The Ethernet addresses (also called MAC address), six bytes long, are
   unique for each card and are assigned in the factory.  The address
   composed by all ones (six #FF bytes) is special: it is the broadcast
   address, and when it appears on the destination address field, it
   indicates that the frame is addressed to all the machines on the
   network, rather than to a given machine only.

   Normal Ethernet addresses have the lowest bit of the first byte set
   to zero.  When it is one, it is a multicast address (the frame is
   addressed to a group of computers).

   The minimum size of an Ethernet frame (including all the headers) is
   64 bytes.  The maximum size is 1514 bytes.

   The "Frame length" of IEEE frames counts from the first byte with
   value 170.  That is, it equals the frame data part plus eight.

   The "Ether-Type" field indicates the type of the frame being
   transported on the frame data part.  The two most commonly used types
   are:

      #0800: IP datagram
      #0806: ARP frame

   Both frame types, Ethernet II and IEEE, can exist mixed in the same
   network.  To know whether an incoming frame is Ehternet II type or
   IEEE type, the 16 byte number placed at positions 12 and 13 of the
   frame must be checked:

   o  If the number is less than or equal to 1500, it is an IEEE frame
      (the number is the frame length).

   o  If the number is greater than 1500, it is an IEEE frame (the
      number is the frame Ether-Type).  All the Ether-Type codes are
      greater than 1500.

   When sending frames, they must be sent in Ethernet II type frames
   unless we know for sure that the machines on the network work
   exclusively with the IEEE format.

   Note that the frame length and Ether-Type fields are stored in Big-
   Endian format, that is with the high byte first; contrarywise to MSX,
   that stores the 16 bit numbers in Little-Endian format, with the low
   byte first.
