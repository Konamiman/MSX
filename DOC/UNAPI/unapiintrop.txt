                       Introduction to MSX-UNAPI

Abstract

   This document introduces MSX-UNAPI, a standard procedure for
   defining, discovering and using new APIs (Application Program
   Interfaces) for MSX computers.  For the detailed specification,
   please read the MSX-UNAPI specification document.

1.  Motivation

   In the last years, several MSX hobbyists have developed various kinds
   of amateur hardware for MSX computers.  Usually, each of these pieces
   of hardware comes with a ROM containing an API (Application Program
   Interface), which consists of a series of routines that allow
   developers to interact with the hardware.

   As each device has its own API, devices are not interchangeable from
   the software point of view.  For example, InterNestor Lite works only
   with the ethernet card ObsoNET, and it will not work with any other
   card developed in the future.

   The MSX-UNAPI specification aims to solve this problem, by defining a
   set of rules for creating interchangeable API implementations.


2.  Key concepts

   The complete MSX-UNAPI specification may seem complicated at first
   glance, but it relies on just a few key concepts, which are
   enumerated below.

   Note: In the following text, the terms "API specification" and "API
   implementation" refer to API specifications and implementations that
   obey the rules of the MSX-UNAPI specification.

   o  An "API specification" is a set of routines for performing a set
      of concrete tasks.  Each specification has a short alphanumeric
      identifier that serves as a signature to uniquely distinguish it
      from other specifications.

         For example, an API specification for ethernet cards could have
         the identifier ETHERNET and be composed of three routines: send
         packet, receive packet and check network state.

   o  An "API implementation" is the realisation in code of an API
      specification.  There may be several implementation of the same
      API specification, and since all of them implement the same set of
      routines, they are interchangeable.  Each implementation has a
      short name that serves to distinguish it from other
      implementations.

         For example, "ObsoNET BIOS" and "Dumas BIOS" could be the names
         of two implementations of the API whose identifier is ETHERNET.
         A TCP/IP stack prepared to deal with the ETHERNET API could
         work with both implementations.

                                MSX-UNAPI                      July 2007


   o  The MSX-UNAPI specification provides a set of minimal rules that
      must be followed by all compliant API specifications and
      implementations.  This is done to ease the development of software
      that make use of API implementations.

         The main rules are: API implementation code must be placed in
         ROM, in mapped RAM or in page 3 RAM; there must be one single
         call point for all the API routines (routine number is passed
         in register A); and there must be one routine that informs
         about the API name and version.  All of this is detailed in the
         MSX-UNAPI specification document.

   o  More than one implementation of a given API specification may be
      installed at the same time.  The MSX extended BIOS mechanism is
      used to discover and locate the available implementations.

         Usually, when more than one implementation is found, it does
         not matter which one is used to perform the tasks offered by
         the API specification.  However, if necessary, implementations
         can be distinguished thanks to their names.


3.  Example

   This example provides pseudo-code for an hypothetical TCP/IP stack
   that relies on the ETHERNET API to send and receive data.  In the
   code, the names A, B, C, HL and DE refer to Z80 registers; other
   names refer to routines or variables.  Semicolons (;) indicate that
   the rest of the line is a comment.

   Please refer to the MSX-UNAPI specification document for details
   about how to call API routines and extended BIOS, as well as Z80
   registers usage.

      PRINT "Welcome to this wonderful ETHERNET API aware TCP/IP stack!"
      PRINT "Now I'm going to search for ETHERNET API implementations...

      POKE &HF847,"ETHERNET"+0
      A=0
      B=0
      DE=&H2222
      CALL &HFFCA ; The EXTBIO hook

      IF B=0 THEN
         PRINT "Ooops!"
         PRINT "I haven't found any ETHERNET API implementation!"
